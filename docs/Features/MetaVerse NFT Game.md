We aim for this to be a community-inclusive brand with tentacles in world-class gaming, online identities, collectibles, merch, and real estate. Owning a Hinges NFT conveys to the owner all the rights associated with the NFT. As the NFT is bought and sold, that ownership is transferred â€” and as ecosystems grow around the NFT, those benefits go to the NFT owner, not just the founding team of Hinges.
 
We are passionate about ensuring that our game is fun, but it's also clear that we must ensure it is rewarding. Our new game design system was created with the vital principle of "gameplay first," making sure that it is enjoyable to play while yet being rewarding.
 
We aim to be the best mobile game that millions will enjoy. Players and community members can turn their passion for gaming into valued digital assets they can own. To achieve this goal and deliver a product of exceptional quality, we need to leverage a mix of cutting-edge technologies and expertly chosen partners.
