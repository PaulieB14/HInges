# Bug Bounty Program


## Have the Hinges token contracts been audited?

* Yes, Hinges Smart contracts and related source materials were audited by independent security researchers. We are hiring a top Smart Contract Audit Company to go through the smart contracts and implement a comprehensive audit before launching. Security for users is a top priority at Hinges. We will run one of the more extensive bounty programs in the space ($250,000), and we will be teaming up with Immunefi (https://immunefi.com/) to give it more visibility. Of course, we cannot guarantee that bugs won't be found in the future.
