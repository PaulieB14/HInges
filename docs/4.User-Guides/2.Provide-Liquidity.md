# Provide Liquidity

To incentivize market liquidity, Hinges' will be distributed to liquidity providers based on a formula that rewards participation in markets. This creates an incentive for liquidity providers to provide depth, promote more efficient prices and improve overall trading quality.

Liquidity mining is easy. If you're interested in liquidity mining, all you have to do is be an LP in the relevant pools. There's nothing more to do. Just hodl! The liquidity mining rewards are automatically sent to your account at the end of the 28-day cycle.

Cooperatively competing with other participants, our liquidity providers can achieve liquidity for Hinges' token and earn economic incentives. In return, they are compensated proportional to their work, according to an algorithmically defined model.

These dynamic rewards increase during bull markets so as to adjust to increasing demand for a token and decrease during bear markets so as to adjust to decreasing demand.

More Details to be revealed soon.
