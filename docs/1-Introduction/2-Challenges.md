# Challenges

One of the most difficult challenges is that DeFi is inherently incompatible with traditional financial frameworks and processes. Addressing these issues will pave the way for DeFi to be used in business financing, investment, and personal money management.
 
Another significant impediment to DeFi's widespread adoption is user experience. Because of their lack of intuitiveness, Defi and Dex's are prone to human errors. They can be difficult for less tech-savvy users.
 
It's no surprise that fraudulent behavior is prevalent in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space, given the lack of checks and balances. Recent hacks and exit scams have resulted in billions of dollars in losses, making safety a primary concern and a significant barrier to institutional adoption.
 
Existing protocols are too expensive and slow to be used on a large scale. The Miner Frontrunning, MEV, and Sandwich attacks add to these difficulties.
 
Many DeFi platforms lack CTAs for user feedback. Complex interfaces, user flows, and interoperability issues will stymie adopting some of these innovations.
 
Most DeFi protocols today are powered by collateralized loans, which can change anytime. The Maker DAO protocol is one of the most widely used lending protocols. However, it charges interest rates ranging from 3% to 10%, depending on how expensive it believes your loan is. Even if you borrow at 2%, your loan can increase by more than twice this amount at certain moments.
 

Some loans include hidden fees such as origination and application fees. These fees may total more than the loan interest rate. These deceptive techniques are only sometimes explained upfront. However, they should be included in the fine print of any documents you sign.
 
Liquidity in DeFi protocols needs to be more cohesive and utilized.
 
The current activity in the space is highly speculative and targeted at existing digital asset holders— and returns are likely to compress over time. The most common reasons for participation appear to be the creation of leverage to buy digital assets or to take advantage of various incentive mechanisms.
 
Inconsistent and risky yields rightly cause users unease and uncertainty. 
 
Today's financially troubled environment, buffeted by high unemployment and strained central banking policies, has shaken global confidence in major financial institutions and state economies.
As a result, individuals and institutions are looking for novel ways to preserve and generate wealth.
 
You've heard the stories: low-value transactions (like credit card payments) are expensive, while high-value transactions take forever. If you're curious, here's what we discovered: Money transfers are now costly, slow, and insecure. Due to inefficient rules and outdated technology, fraud, and chargeback management costs banks more than $15 billion annually. Despite that, they still need to find a way to transform the industry by doing it differently.
 
Today's real estate industry faces numerous sustainability and energy conservation challenges. The industry's biggest challenge is meeting ambitious new sustainability targets while maintaining profit margins at the previous year's levels.
 

People are discouraged by daunting terminology, a need for more connections, and an extremely high entry barrier. Due to their inability to come up with the initial investment required for down payments and the numerous operational requirements of owning a property, most individuals are barred from investing in real estate.
 
The nature of real estate investments has kept many people away. Real estate investment has traditionally been one of the most capital-intensive businesses and investments to pursue. Investors believe investing in stocks is far easier and less expensive than investing in real estate.
 
Investors are limited to markets and properties close to them because they must live nearby to manage the property, in addition to a lack of proper research and exit strategy.
 
From the perspective of the 1.7 billion people worldwide who are unbanked or underbanked, the current financial system is working against us. In an age when systems can fail without warning, we must reconsider our old ways of doing things.
 

Profiteering corrupts financial systems, as it does all human institutions. We have an economic system designed to prioritize the interests of bankers and investors over the interests of the people, with predictable outcomes. The global financial crisis proves that greed can corrupt even the most well-intentioned institutions.
 
Web3 gaming's current model of siloed economies and experiences will quickly become an insurmountable barrier for most gamers worldwide — for whom high friction equates to low fun.
MOST GAMES LACK ENGAGEMENT, focusing far too heavily on tokenomics and earning aspects over gameplay. The blockchain-first rather than the fun-first model needs to be revised.
 

Repetitive gameplay and a shorter duration of gameplay make it even more boring for the player.
GameFi faces challenges from clunky onboarding, high barrier to entry, poor-in-game economy design, scalability, clunky user experience, interoperability constraints of Web2 "metaverse" platforms, and gaming experiences that just "aren't fun."
 

One of the most common misconceptions about blockchain gaming is that it is environmentally damaging and unsustainable. GameFi players (in their present state) are mostly short-term value creators looking to become value extractors and get rich quickly.
 

Considering the learning requirements for new players unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications, player integration, and accessibility remain the most pressing problems in the blockchain game.
